and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

[Unreleased]
### Added
- Added [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) coverage.
- Added/enable [Codeship](https://app.codeship.com) test build on Python 3.7.2 with manually-installed tkinter via `sudo apt-get install -y python3-tk`.

[0.3.2-alpha]
### Added
- Improved test coverage.
### Changed
- Implementation of `take_student_scores`:
    - Move fetching of student data into `if` clause, fetch only if student has a score.
    - Simplify conditional to only filter out scores of `None` rather than chained conditional testing for values evaluating to `True` or `0`.
- Chart generation test scripts moved to dedicated folder in `test_suite`.
- Refactor application exit, `main_menu`:
    - Move `quit_app` to `app_main`, have `quit_app` call `check_registry_on_exit` before call to `sys.exit`.
    - Refactor `main_menu` and `take_main_menu_input` to use flag for exit call. `take_main_menu_input` returns `True` instead of `None` if use chooses to quit. 
- Simplify loop in `take_main_menu_input` preferring `if; if` over `if elif else`.
### Fixed
- `check_registry_on_exit` is now called on exit. Previously was called after `sys.exit` and not run. 

## [0.3.1-alpha] - 2019-02-06
### Added
- Improved test coverage.
- Add load_chart_data, load_json_from_file
- Add .bettercodehub.yml - prevent failed PR checks because of test code.
### Changed
- Refactor save_as_dialogue to prevent TypeError.
- Refactor load_class_data using load_from_json_file.
- Rename take_custom_chart_options to get_custom_chart_options to avoid name conflict. Calls UI function take_custom_chart_options.
### Fixed
- Fix bug where avatar for student with score of 0 not added to student_scores.
- Fix bug in save_as_dialogue that failed with TypeError when called without filetypes parameter or with default filetypes=None.
- Fix circleci not storing test metadata.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2019-01-23
### Added
- Improved test coverage.
- Add Contact note, saythanks.io badge to README.
- Add currently unimplemented select_student/take_student_selection functions mirroring similar class selection functionality.
- Select class/student dialogues will now take exact name of class/student (as well as integer per user direction), note this is to be considered an implementation detail, since a class with an integer name will only be selectable by entering that name if the integer is not displayed/larger that the number of options. 
### Changed
- Bugfixes
    - Fix path for default_avatar.
    - Fix cwd set in TestDataFolder.test_generate_data_path_defaults to draw from ROOT_DIR.
    - Fix bug - essentially blank (eg '_') chart name caused infinite loop. 
    - Add '.png' to save filename, as it is not otherwise appended.
- Major refactor of chart display and saving code.
    - Fixes major bugs where blank image would be saved, app would hang indefinitely.
    - Chart image now saves to app_data. Saved image is then displayed using Tkinter with a 'Save as' button. When this is pressed, image window disappears and os 'save as' dialogue is spawned, user can save where and as they choose.
    - Pillow is used to process the image, resize it for display.
- Refactor UI elements into dedicated functions and scripts in UI_menus.
- Add Pillow dependency, remove as yet unused numpy.
- Move converting int to str responsibility to UI functions taking input rather than doing so in function creating enumerated dict.


## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2018-12-31
### Added
- Save chart dialogue.
    - OS native 'save as' dialogue.
    - Starting default folder to class folder in dionysus charts ie dionysus_charts/class_name.

    - Travis CI
        - Install testing dependencies from requirements_dev.txt rather than manually. 
        - Require passing tests Python 3.7 on Linux for successful build.
 ### Removed
- app_data/image_data folder.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2018-12-10
Initial alpha release! Dionysus will take class lists, and successfully produce charts with the default avatar.

### Known bugs/non-functional features:
- setup.py is boilerplate and untested.
- User supplied avatar does not copy to app data folder and thus does not work in app.
- No indication of chart save location and not saving in desired/intended location in app_data/image_data/
- Need to cut and paste/type user supplied avatar location is too awkward.
- Preview/display of created chart does not reflect generated image accurately.
